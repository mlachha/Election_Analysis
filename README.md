# Election Analysis
## Project Overview

A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given us the following tasks to complete the
election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

### Resources

* Data Source: election_results.csv
* Software: Python 3.9.0, Visual Studio Code, 1.54.1

#### The candidates were:

* Charles Casper Stockham
* Diana DeGette
* Raymon Anthony Doane

#### The candidate results were:

the total number of vote tallied was **"369,711"**, out of that:

* **Charles Casper Stockham** received **"23.0%"** of the vote and **"85,213"** number of votes.
* **Diana DeGette** received **"73.8%"** of the vote and **"272,892"** number of votes.
* **Raymon Anthony Doane** received **"3.1%"** of the vote and **"11,606"** number of votes.

#### The winner of the election was:

* **Diana DeGette**, who received **"73.8%"** of the vote and **"272,892"** number of votes.

## County Details 

the Colorado Board of Elections employee is requesting more details about the votes, this time he's interested in the counties where the votes were tallied.
the counties details is as follows:


* **Jefferson** County got **10.5%** of the vote with **38,855** total votes
* **Denver** County got  **82.8%**  of the vote with **306,055** total votes
* **Arapahoe** County got **6.7%**  of the vote with **24,801** total votes

which makes **Denver** county the one with the highest voters turnout.

### Summary

The analysis of the election show that:
There were "369,711" votes cast in the election, out of which Diana DeGette, the winner, got 272,892 votes. While Denver led the other counties in term of turnout with 306055 vote.


#### NOTE:

the code attached in the (.Py) files could be reused to audit other election results, and could be also readapted to add more functionalities in the future with the hope for more granularity in the future voting data.
